// 5) Using the data from exercise 4. How would you represent it if the data was needed to be accessed
// easily by color? And how if it was needed to be accessed by size?

// With the array of objects i made in exercise 4, i could access to colors maping the array and checking every object color property, same for size.

// for e.g
// cars.map(car => (
//     <p>the car is {car.color} and his size is {car.size}</p>
// ))
